# Each entry in this list should resolve to
# a partial or complete resource definition file.
#
# The names in these (possibly partial) resource files
# must match names already loaded via the `resources`
# field or via `resources` loaded transitively via the
# `bases` entries.  These entries are used to _patch_
# (modify) the known resources.
#
# Small patches that do one thing are best, e.g. modify
# a memory request/limit, change an env var in a
# ConfigMap, etc.  Small patches are easy to review and
# easy to mix together in overlays.

# Each entry in this list should resolve to
# a kubernetes object and a JSON patch that will be applied
# to the object.
# The JSON patch is documented at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902
#
# target field points to a kubernetes object within the same kustomization
# by the object's group, version, kind, name and namespace.
# path field is a relative file path of a JSON patch file.
# The content in this patch file can be either in JSON format as
#
#  [
#    {"op": "add", "path": "/some/new/path", "value": "value"},
#    {"op": "replace", "path": "/some/existing/path", "value": "new value"}
#  ]
#
# or in YAML format as
#
# - op: add
#   path: /some/new/path
#   value: value
# - op:replace
#   path: /some/existing/path
#   value: new value
