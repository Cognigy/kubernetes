## Monitoring
This release of our products removes the old monitoring stack entirely. Cognigy has created a new monitoring stack based on the same open-source technologies (Prometheus, Alertmanager & Grafana). If you are interested in using the new monitoring solution, please get in touch with us by sending an email to `support@cognigy.com`.

We have removed the `monitoring` folder entirely.
