# 4.26.0
## Cognigy.AI / Cognigy Insights (core)
The referenced container images have changed.

This release also introduces a couple of new files which are not relevant, yet. So please ignore the following files:
- `core/manifests/deployments/service-app-session-manager.yaml`
- `core/template.dist/product/secrets.dist/cognigy-service-app-session-manager.yaml`

The `nlp-deployments` folder also contains new components in the respective sub-folders - this can also be ignored.

**The new files are only here as we prepare some changes for future Cognigy.AI versions - you can ignore them for now as we will mention changes as soon as they are relevant.**
